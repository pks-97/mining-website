	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>The Department of Mining Engineering, a well conceived dream of the founder of this University PANDIT MADAN MOHAN MALVIYAJI and the oldest Mining Engineering Department in the country, came into existence as early as 1923, as a section of the Department of Geology, Mining and Metallurgy. Later, in the year 1944, separate departments of Mining and Metallurgy were constituted under the College of Mining and Metallurgy.</p> 
<p>The first Ph.D. degree in Mining Engineering in the country was awarded from this department in the year 1964. This lead was further strengthened by introducing the First Post-Graduate course in 1966 leading to M.Sc. degree in Mining Engineering in Metal Mining and Coal Mining, respectively and later the M.Sc. degree in Mine Planning was introduced in 1972. From the session 1995-96 the department offers M. Tech. degree in Mine Environment, Mine Planning and Rock Mechanics. </p>

<p>The Department of Mining Engineering, BHU in fact was one of the first few departments in the country to receive UGC Assistance under COSIST and SAP Programme in 1984. Subsequently, the Department was upgraded as a Centre of Advanced Study in the area of Rock Mechanics and Ground Control in 1990. </p>

<p>Starting from the triumphant beginning , the Department is now the biggest in the country with all facilities related to Mining Engineering under one roof. The Department is divided into six divisions with laboratories well equipped with both conventional and modern facilities. Facilities have been developed for research in collaboration with mining industry in dealing with their practical problems and also problems of fundamental nature. Given below are the major Divisions of the Department:</p>
